# Demand Sensitivity & Price Impact Prediction

This project analyzes how demand responds to changes in price and promotional activity. The objective is to quantify price sensitivity and promotional impact using regression-based modeling, and to translate analytical results into insights that support pricing and promotion decisions.

The work focuses on interpretability and model reliability, using standard data science techniques to ensure results are both statistically sound and practically useful.

## Approach
- Analyze historical sales and pricing data
- Explore demand patterns across pricing and promotion scenarios
- Build regression-based machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Interpret feature impact to derive business insights

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Datasets used for analysis  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling  
- `visuals/` – Plots and visual outputs generated during analysis  

## Status
Project setup complete. Analysis and modeling notebooks will be added incrementally.
